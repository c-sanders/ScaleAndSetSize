This is the INSTALL file which is associated with the GIMP scaleAndSetSize
Plugin.

This Plugin is implemented as a single Python source code file called ;

	scaleAndSetSize.py

To install this Plugin, simply copy it to one of the directories which GIMP
searches for Plugins. Refer to ;

	https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/Installing_Plugins

for more information about Gimp Plugins and where to install them.

As an example, if you are running Gimp under Linux, and you want to install the
Plugin in your home directory, then you could install it in a directory such as
the following ;

	/home/username/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins/

Note however, that installing it within your home directory means that you will
be the only user who is able to use it.
