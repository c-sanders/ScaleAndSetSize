Filename    : INSTALL
################################################################################

This is the INSTALL file which is associated with the GIMP scaleAndSetSize
Plugin.

This Plugin is implemented as two Python source code files which are called ;

  scaleAndSetSize.py
  ScaleAndSetSizeObject.py

The first file implements the Plugin and registers it with GIMP, while the
second file implements a helper class. It is this helper class which does most
of the work for the Plugin. 

To install this Plugin, simply copy both of these files to one of the
directories which GIMP searches for Plugins. Refer to ;

  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/Installing_Plugins

for more information about Gimp Plugins and where to install them.

As an example, if you are running Gimp under Linux, and you want to install the
Plugin in your home directory, then you could install these files in a directory
such as the following ;

  /home/username/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins/

After the files have been installed into the necessary directory, please make
sure that they have the appropriate permission bits set. For example,
scaleAndSetSize.py needs to have the appropriate execute permission bits set.
For example, something like the following would be sufficient;

  -r-xr--r--

while ScaleAndSetSizeObject.py shouldn't have any of its execute permission bits
set. For example, something like the following would be sufficient;

  -r--r--r--

The reason for not setting any of the execute permission bits on the
ScaleAndSetSizeObject.py file, is because if they are, then GIMP will try to
load the file as a GIMP Plugin.

Also, be aware that installing a Plugin into your home directory means that you
will be the only user who is able to use it.
